    <h2>What is Css?</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Css stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li><br>
        <li>Css describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.</li><br>
        <li><span class="demo">Css is not neccesary</span><span class="demo2">CSS saves a lot of work.</span> It can control the layout of
             multiple web pages all at once</li><br>
        <li><span class="demo3">External stylesheets are stroed in Css files.</span></li><br>

    </ol>

    <h2>Css can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Inline by using the style attribute inside HTML elements</li>
        <li>Internal-by using a style element in the head section</li>
        <li>External-by using a link element to link to an external css file</li>
        <li>The most common way to add css,is to keep the styles in external css file, however <span class="demo4">in this<br>
             tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span> this is easier to demonstrate,
            and easier for you to try it yourself.</li>

    </ul>

    <p>When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a styles to multiple elements.id,
        on the other hand, applies a styles to one unique element.
        ID is also spcial in that you can use a special URL to 
         link directly to an element and its used bt Javascript. </p>

    <p>In CSS,selectors are used to target a specific element on a web page.
        once an element has been targeted,a
        style can be applied to the element.</p>
    
    <p>There is a wide rang of selectors available, two of the most commonly used are class and ID.
        both are used to target element to which a style should be applied.</p>
